File 1/14: test_documents_complete.py
Status: REVIEWING NOW
Issues Found: Uses /upload endpoint (single file), needs /batch-upload
Actions: Will update to match current API

Updates needed:
- Line 43: Change endpoint from /upload to /batch-upload
- Update to use files array not single file
- Align categories to real types: formation, internal_controls, bank_statements, tax, receipts, other
- Add tests for 13 real document scenarios
- Test file sizes from 9KB to 1.3MB range
- Test actual filenames from user uploads

Executing fixes now...
