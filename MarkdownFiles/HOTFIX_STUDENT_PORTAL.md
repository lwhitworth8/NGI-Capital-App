# Student Portal Hotfixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Build Error in StudentProjectModal
**Error:** `Expected '</', got 'jsx text'` at line 378

**Cause:** The "Closed Project Message" section was placed outside the grid layout but inside the p-8 div, causing JSX structure issues.

**Fix:** Removed the orphaned closed project message section. The status is already shown in the status badge at the top of the modal.

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/student/src/components/projects/StudentProjectModal.tsx`

### 2. ✅ UC Berkeley Only Message
**Issue:** Blocked page said "Only UC Berkeley students" but the system accepts all UC domains

**Cause:** The message was outdated and didn't reflect that ALL UC campuses are allowed.

**Fix:** Updated the message to say "Only UC system students" and listed all accepted domains.

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/student/src/app/blocked/page.tsx`

**Accepted Domains:**
- @berkeley.edu
- @ucla.edu
- @ucsd.edu
- @uci.edu
- @ucdavis.edu
- @ucsb.edu
- @ucsc.edu
- @ucr.edu
- @ucmerced.edu
- @ngicapitaladvisory.com (for admins)

### 3. ✅ Settings Access Issue
**Issue:** UC Berkeley students (and all UC students) were getting blocked from accessing Settings

**Cause:** The middleware and auth routes had no default value for `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`. If the environment variable wasn't set, it would default to an empty string, which could cause unexpected behavior.

**Fix:** Added default values to all domain checking locations:
- `apps/student/src/middleware.ts` - Added default UC domains
- `apps/student/src/app/auth/resolve/route.ts` - Added default UC domains + NGI domain
- `apps/student/src/lib/gating.ts` - Updated comment for clarity

**Default Domain List:**
```
berkeley.edu,ucla.edu,ucsd.edu,uci.edu,ucdavis.edu,ucsb.edu,ucsc.edu,ucr.edu,ucmerced.edu,ngicapitaladvisory.com
```

### 4. ✅ Added Logging
Added console warnings in middleware when blocking domains to help debug future issues:
```typescript
console.warn('[middleware] Blocking non-UC domain:', { email: em, domain, allowed })
```

## Testing Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] All UC students can access Settings
- [ ] All UC students can view Projects
- [ ] Non-UC emails get blocked properly
- [ ] Blocked page shows correct message
- [ ] Admin emails (@ngicapitaladvisory.com) can access

### Student Accounts to Test:
- [ ] @berkeley.edu
- [ ] @ucla.edu
- [ ] @ucsd.edu
- [ ] @uci.edu
- [ ] @ucdavis.edu
- [ ] @ucsb.edu
- [ ] @ucsc.edu
- [ ] @ucr.edu
- [ ] @ucmerced.edu

### Pages to Test Access:
- [ ] /projects (should be public, no auth needed)
- [ ] /settings (requires UC auth)
- [ ] /my-projects (requires UC auth)
- [ ] /learning (should be public)

## Environment Variable

**Optional:** You can still set `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` in your `.env` file to override the defaults:

```env
ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=berkeley.edu,ucla.edu,ucsd.edu,uci.edu,ucdavis.edu,ucsb.edu,ucsc.edu,ucr.edu,ucmerced.edu,ngicapitaladvisory.com
```

**But it's now optional** - the system will work with all UC domains by default even if the variable isn't set.
