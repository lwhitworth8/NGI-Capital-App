# My Projects (Student) â€“ Overview (Expanded)

View and manage your assigned project work: tasks, submissions, comments, meetings, timesheets, and resources. Projects appear here only after onboarding completes. Keep submissions under 500 MB per file and use the built-in upload with progress. Meetings open in Google Calendar; task feedback arrives via in-app notifications (and Slack reminders in the team channel).
