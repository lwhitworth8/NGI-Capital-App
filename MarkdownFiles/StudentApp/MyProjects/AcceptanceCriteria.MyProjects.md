# My Projects (Student) â€“ Acceptance Criteria

## Access & Listing
- Given onboarding completed for a project, when the student opens My Projects, then the project appears under Active; otherwise it is hidden.
- Given a project is completed, when viewing My Projects, then it appears under Past and remains viewable read-only.

## Tasks & Submissions
- Given an individual task, when the student submits and the lead approves, then only that student is marked complete.
- Given a group task, when any assignee submits and the lead approves, then all assignees are marked complete for that task.
- Given a past-due submission, when submitted, then it shows a Late flag; status remains Review until approved.

## Comments & Notifications
- Given the lead adds a comment or requests revisions, then the student receives an in-app notification; when the student opens the task detail, the notification clears.

## Meetings
- Given a scheduled meeting, when the student clicks Open, then Google Calendar opens for the event (no Meet link shown in-app); Slack reminder posts 10 minutes before start.

## Timesheets
- Given the student logs segments for a week, then weekly totals and variance vs planned hours are shown; entries remain editable in V1.
