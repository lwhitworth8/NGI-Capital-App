# Student Projects – Open Questions

- Infinite scroll API params: finalize cursor vs offset; backend support for majors/mode/location filters.
- “Most Applied” sort: requires applications count aggregation; confirm backend endpoint/field.
- Location data source: stored per project or inferred from description/tags?
- PDF viewer fallback: browser support strategy for embed vs object tag.
- Applications snapshot: store resume snapshot per application for consistency?
- Coffee chat slot cadence: how far into the future to show; slot expiration rules.
- Cooldown after missed chat: should students be temporarily blocked from re‑requesting?
