# Student Learning – Acceptance Criteria (Coming Soon)

- Given a student visits /learning, then they see an on-brand hero with the text “Student Learning — Coming Soon” and a brief subtext, and there are no interactive elements on the page.
- Given dark or light theme, then the placeholder respects theme tokens and contrast requirements.
- Given mobile viewport, then the layout remains readable and uncluttered.
