# Student Learning — Acceptance Criteria (V1)

- Given a student opens `/learning`, then they see modules, a curated 10‑company picker, and a download CTA; selection persists.
- Given a company is selected, then downloading emits an Excel package with required tabs, Raw Import (locked), and Drivers Map.
- Given an activity submission, then validators run; if they fail, fixes show with clear guidance; if they pass, feedback appears.
- Given resubmission, then a new version is created and the delta summary is viewable.
- Given capstone submission, then model/memo/deck are accepted, football field is present, and leaderboard contribution recorded.
- Given progress, then bars and streaks update (≥15m or activity); streak resets after 8 inactive days.
- Given the coach is used, then responses arrive < 60s on average and reference the current activity context.
- Given integrity checks, then high‑confidence AI‑generated finals are blocked with guidance to revise in the student’s voice.
- Given telemetry constraints, then events fire with no PII beyond user_id.
- Given accessibility, then keyboard‑only flows, focus states, SR labels, and chart alt text are correct.
