# Student Learning – PRD (Coming Soon Placeholder)

## 0) Context & Goal
Provide a simple, on-brand placeholder page in the student portal for the future Learning module. It communicates “Student Learning — Coming Soon” with a brief sentence and no interactive elements or data collection.

## 1) Scope (V1)
- Single page at /learning.
- Minimal content: headline + short subtext. No CTAs, no forms, no links, no email capture.
- Theming and layout consistent with the rest of the student app (typography, spacing, colors, dark mode).

## 2) Out of Scope (V1)
- Curriculum details, roadmap, signups, social links, FAQs.
- Any backend or analytics beyond a basic page view.

## 3) Requirements
- Heading: “Student Learning — Coming Soon”.
- Subtext: One line describing that the Learning module will launch in a future release.
- Visual: Optional subtle gradient/spotlight background consistent with app theme.
- Responsive: Looks good on desktop; degrades gracefully on mobile.
- Accessibility: Proper heading level, contrast, and focus handling; no interactive controls present.

## 4) Telemetry (Optional)
- Track a page_view event for /learning (if standard page analytics are in place). No PII captured.

## 5) Success Criteria
- Page renders consistently across themes; contains no CTAs or input; communicates “Coming Soon” clearly.
