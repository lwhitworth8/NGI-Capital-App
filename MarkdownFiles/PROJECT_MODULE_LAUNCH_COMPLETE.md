## Files Created

2. `apps/student/src/components/projects/ApplicationModal.tsx` - New application modal component
3. `MarkdownFiles/PROJECT_MODULE_LAUNCH_COMPLETE.md` - This summary document

## Files Modified
1. `apps/desktop/src/components/advisory/ModernProjectCard.tsx`
2. `apps/desktop/src/components/advisory/ProjectDetailModal.tsx`
3. `apps/student/src/components/projects/ModernProjectCard.tsx`
4. `apps/student/src/components/projects/StudentProjectModal.tsx`

## Next Steps - For User Implementation

### 1. Run Test Projects Script
```bash
cd tests
python create_test_projects.py
```
This will create the 4 test projects in your database.

### 2. Implement Resume Upload in Settings (CRITICAL)
**Required for application functionality:**

**Backend Changes Needed:**
- Add `resume_url` field to student/user profile table
- Create endpoint: `PUT /api/settings/resume` (upload resume file)
- Create endpoint: `GET /api/settings/profile` (get user profile with resume_url)
- Store resume files securely (S3, Azure Blob, or local storage)

**Frontend Changes Needed:**
- Update Settings page to include resume upload section
- File upload component with preview
- Store resume URL in user session/context
- Pass `hasResumeUploaded` and `resumeUrl` to ApplicationModal from real data

**Current Placeholders in `StudentProjectModal.tsx` (lines 44-47):**
```typescript
const hasResumeUploaded = false // TODO: Get from user settings
const resumeUrl = '' // TODO: Get from user profile
const hasCoffeeChat = false // TODO: Check if user has scheduled chat
```

### 3. Implement Coffee Chat Tracking
**Required for coffee chat status:**

**Backend:**
- Create `coffee_chats` table (student_id, project_id, scheduled_date, status)
- Create endpoint: `GET /api/coffee-chats/status/:projectId`
- Create endpoint: `POST /api/coffee-chats/schedule` (for scheduling)

**Frontend:**
- Fetch coffee chat status when viewing project
- Pass `hasCoffeeChat` boolean to ApplicationModal
- Implement coffee chat scheduling UI (currently placeholder)

### 4. Update Application API Endpoint
The ApplicationModal posts to `/api/public/applications` with:
```json
{
  "project_id": number,
  "responses": { "q_{questionId}": "answer", ... },
  "resume_url": string
}
```

**Ensure your backend:**
- Accepts this format
- Stores application responses properly
- Associates with application_questions table

### 5. Test Theme Compatibility
- Test all views in light mode
- Test all views in dark mode
- Verify client logos display correctly in both themes
- Check modal backgrounds and text contrast

### 6. Add Client Logos
If using local logos, ensure these files exist:
- `apps/desktop/public/clients/*.svg`
- `apps/student/public/clients/*.svg`

Or the code will fallback to Clearbit Logo API.

### 7. Test Application Flow
1. Student views project
2. Clicks "Apply" button
3. Sees resume requirement if not uploaded
4. Sees coffee chat recommendation
5. Fills out application questions
6. Submits application
7. Receives confirmation

## Design Decisions

### Why Separate Application Modal?
- Cleaner code organization
- Reusable across different project views
- Better UX with dedicated focus
- Easier to maintain and test
- Proper validation and error handling

### Why Two-Column Layout in Modals?
- Matches modern SaaS application design
- Clear separation of information vs actions
- Better use of screen space
- Consistent between admin and student views

### Why Parse Comma-Separated Clients?
- Supports legacy data format
- Allows multiple clients per project
- Each client gets proper visual treatment
- Scalable for projects with many partners

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
1. Resume upload not yet implemented (placeholder values)
2. Coffee chat tracking not yet implemented
3. Coffee chat scheduling is placeholder UI
4. Application questions must be in database (can't add ad-hoc)

### Future Enhancements:
1. Rich text editor for application questions
2. File attachments in applications
3. Application draft saving
4. Application status tracking for students
5. Email notifications on application submission
6. Calendar integration for coffee chats
7. Video introductions/portfolio links
