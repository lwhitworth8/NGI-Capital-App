# Appendix — Internal Rubric (V1)

Rubric is internal (not shown to students). Applied only after validators pass. Each dimension scored 1–5 with anchors; overall artifact quality contributes 50% to talent signal.

## Dimensions & Weights (Total 100)
- Model Integrity & Standards — 30
  - 5: All ties perfect; standards followed; zero unresolved warnings.
  - 3: Minor formula/format deviations; all ties intact.
  - 1: Broken ties; hardcodes in calc areas; missing checks.
- Driver Logic & Traceability — 20
  - 5: Q/P/take-rate sourced; units correct; residuals explained; clear lineage from IR/SEC.
  - 3: Mostly sourced; minor unit or rounding issues; limited notes.
  - 1: Hand-wavy or unsourced drivers; mismatched units.
- Valuation Soundness — 20
  - 5: WACC inputs defensible; terminal method appropriate; sensitivities coherent; sanity vs peers.
  - 3: Some assumptions okay; sensitivity ranges narrow; minor inconsistencies.
  - 1: Terminal/discount incoherent; peer mismatch ignored.
- Insight & Synthesis — 15
  - 5: Clear “so what”; links assumptions → outcomes; risks framed with probabilities.
  - 3: Mostly descriptive; limited synthesis.
  - 1: No insight; copy/paste of statements.
- Communication & Tone — 10
  - 5: Executive clarity; tight structure; professional language; defensible choices.
  - 3: Understandable but verbose or casual; mixed structure.
  - 1: Unclear or promotional.
- Professional Polish — 5
  - 5: Banker-grade formatting, naming, and charts.
  - 3: Minor style issues.
  - 1: Sloppy or inconsistent.

## Scoring
- Each dimension 1–5 → weighted sum / 5 → 0–100 artifact score.
- Talent signal uses artifact quality (50%) alongside completion (30%) and improvement velocity (20%). See Appendix.TalentSignal.md.
