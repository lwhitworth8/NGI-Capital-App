|------|------------|
| Data variance across IR sources | Drivers Map standardization, notes fields |
| Over-reliance on AI | Strict validators, emphasis on reasoning |
| Model brittleness | Clear standards, iteration, guardrails |
| Performance (animation rendering) | Pre-rendering, caching, CDN |
| Cost overruns (OpenAI) | Rate limiting, validator gates, GPT-3.5-Turbo |
| Security vulnerabilities | OWASP compliance, regular audits, Snyk |
