## Next Steps Options

### Option A: Finish Content Expansion (2-3 hours)
- Complete Accounting II & Managerial details
- Complete Finance Unit 3-5 (DCF, Comps, Capstone)
- Result: 200+ hours of ready-to-implement content

### Option B: Start Development Now (recommended)
- Content is sufficient to start building infrastructure
- Can finish content expansion in parallel with development
- Prioritize: Epic 1 (Company Package Generator)

### Option C: Complete Documentation First (1-2 hours)
- Finish Excel Standards, Validators, Database Schema docs
- Then start development with complete technical specs
- More organized, but delays actual building

## Recommendation

**Start Epic 1 Development (Company Package Generator)** while you review the content we've created. This gives you tangible progress (Excel packages to show investors) while I finalize remaining documentation in parallel.

**Rationale:**
1. We have 150+ hours of content already (Business + Accounting I + Finance 1-2)
2. That's enough to demonstrate depth and quality to investors
3. Ingestion pipeline is most technically impressive component
4. Can expand Accounting II and DCF content while pipeline is being built
5. Having real Excel packages > having perfect documentation

## Questions for You

1. **Which would you prefer:**
   - A) Finish all content expansion first (2-3 more hours)
   - B) Start building ingestion pipeline + Excel generation NOW
   - C) Complete all documentation (Excel Standards, Validators, etc.) first

2. **For investor pitch, which demo would be most compelling:**
   - A) Show completed content (lessons, exercises, memos)
   - B) Show generated Excel package (banker-grade model with real data)
   - C) Show end-to-end flow (pick company → download package → AI coach)

3. **Timeline:** When is your investor pitch? This helps prioritize.

4. **Review request:** Please review the content in:
   - `Appendix.Modules.ContentMap.md` (Business Foundations)
   - `Appendix.Modules.Accounting.Detailed.md` (Accounting I)
   - `Appendix.Modules.Finance.Detailed.md` (Finance Units 1-2)
   
   Is this the depth and quality you envisioned?
