# NGI Learning Module - Frontend Refactor Complete

**Completed:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY  
**Major Changes:** Module-based navigation, Dark/Light theme support, Admin talent tracking

---

## Overview

Complete redesign of the NGI Learning Module frontend with a focus on modern UX, proper module-based learning flow, theme consistency, and comprehensive admin talent tracking for identifying top performers.

---

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed API Connection Issues ✅

**Problem:** `Failed to fetch` errors due to API_BASE not being properly set

**Solution:**
- Updated `apps/student/src/lib/api/learning.ts` with proper runtime config
- Added fallback handling for both server-side and client-side rendering
- Created `.env.local.example` file with configuration template

```typescript
const API_BASE = typeof window !== 'undefined' 
  ? (window as any).__RUNTIME_CONFIG__?.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000'
  : process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
```

---

### 2. Dark/Light Theme Support ✅

**Implementation:**
- All learning components now respect user's theme preference
- Used Tailwind's `dark:` variants throughout
- Integrated with Next.js `next-themes` package
- Consistent color palette across light and dark modes

**Updated Components:**
- `apps/student/src/app/learning/page.tsx` - Main learning center
- `apps/student/src/app/learning/[module_id]/page.tsx` - Module detail pages
- `apps/student/src/components/learning/CompanySelector.tsx` - Company selection
- `apps/student/src/components/learning/ProgressTracker.tsx` - Progress tracking

**Color System:**
```css
Light Mode:
- Background: bg-gray-50 / bg-white
- Text: text-gray-900 / text-gray-600
- Borders: border-gray-200

Dark Mode:
- Background: bg-gray-950 / bg-gray-900
- Text: text-white / text-gray-400
- Borders: border-gray-800
```

---

### 3. Module-Based Navigation ✅

**New Structure:**

**Before (Old):**
- Single page with company selector
- Activities list

   - Display all 10 modules as cards
   - Show "Available" vs "Coming Soon" status
   - Display user stats (streak, completion, etc.)
   - Modern tech company UI/UX

2. **Module Detail Pages** (`/learning/[module_id]`)
   - Step 1: Select company from curated 10
   - Step 2: Access module content (units, lessons, exercises)
   - Unit navigation sidebar
   - Progress tracking per module
   - Resources and downloadables

**Available Modules (V1):**

### 4. Student Leaderboard Removed ✅

**Rationale:** Per PRD, leaderboard is for admin tracking only, not student competition.

**Changes:**
- Removed `Leaderboard.tsx` from student components
- Removed leaderboard API calls from student views
- All competitive/ranking features moved to admin dashboard

---

### 5. Admin Talent Tracking Added ✅

**New Admin Page:** `apps/desktop/src/app/advisory/talent/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Comprehensive student talent dashboard
- Real-time search and filtering
- Multiple sort options (talent signal, completion, quality)
- Elite performer identification

**Talent Signal Calculation:**
- **Completion (30%):** Modules and activities completed
- **Artifact Quality (50%):** Average GPT-5 feedback scores on submissions
- **Improvement Velocity (20%):** Rate of score improvement over time

**Talent Tiers:**
- **Elite:** 80+ (top performers, ready for advisory work)
- **Strong:** 60-79 (solid progress, high quality)
- **Promising:** 40-59 (good trajectory, needs more work)
- **Developing:** <40 (early stage, needs support)

**Admin API Endpoints:**

**Backend:** `src/api/routes/learning_admin.py`

```
GET /api/learning/admin/talent
- Returns all students with talent metrics
- Query params: sort, limit, offset
- Admin authentication required

GET /api/learning/admin/talent/{user_id}
- Returns detailed talent data for specific student
- Admin authentication required
```

**Metrics Displayed:**
- Talent Signal (composite score)
- Completion Percentage (with progress bar)
- Artifact Quality Score (0-100)
- Improvement Velocity (%)
- Current Streak (days with fire icon)
- Total Submissions
- Modules Completed (list)
- Last Activity (timestamp)

**UI Features:**
- Search by name/email
- Sort by talent signal, completion, or quality
- Stats cards showing elite performers, high achievers, etc.
- Detailed talent signal methodology explanation
- Visual progress bars and badges
- Responsive design for desktop/tablet

---

### 6. Modern Tech Company UI/UX ✅

**Design Philosophy:**
- Clean, minimal interface inspired by Stripe, Linear, Vercel
- Generous white space (dark mode: generous dark space)
- Card-based layouts with subtle shadows
- Interactive hover states
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Icon-driven navigation
- Professional color palette

**Typography:**
- System font stack for fast loading
- Clear hierarchy (h1: 3xl/4xl, h2: 2xl, body: base)
- Readable line heights
- Proper contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliant)

**Components:**
- Glassmorphic cards
- Gradient accents on key actions
- Skeleton loaders for data fetching
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Modal dialogs for confirmations
- Responsive grid layouts

**Accessibility:**
