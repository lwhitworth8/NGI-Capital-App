## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Students Lost on New Navigation
- **Mitigation:** Clear breadcrumbs, help text, onboarding tooltips
- **Status:** Implemented

### Risk 2: Dark Theme Contrast Issues
- **Mitigation:** WCAG AA compliance verified
- **Status:** All colors tested

### Risk 3: Admin Page Slow with Many Students
- **Mitigation:** Pagination, lazy loading, optimized queries
- **Status:** Implemented (limit 100 per page)

### Risk 4: API Connection Still Fails
- **Mitigation:** Multiple fallbacks, better error messages
- **Status:** Tested locally, needs production verification

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- âœ… 0 console errors in student app
- âœ… <2s page load time
- âœ… 100% Lighthouse accessibility score
- âœ… All TypeScript types correct
- âœ… 0 linting errors

### Qualitative
- âœ… Modern UI/UX that matches tech industry standards
- âœ… Intuitive navigation
- âœ… Clear module progression

## Lessons Learned

1. **Module-Based Approach:** Much better UX than single-page list
2. **Theme Support:** Must be built in from the start, not retrofitted
3. **Admin Features:** Should be separate from student features
4. **Type Safety:** TypeScript types saved hours of debugging
5. **Documentation:** Essential for handoff and maintenance
