## üé® UI DESIGN (Modern 2025)

### Main Tabs (Employees Module):
1. **Dashboard** - KPIs, quick actions
2. **Employees** - Employee list with filters
3. **Teams/Projects** - Org structure (tabs for regular entities vs Advisory)
4. **Timesheets** - Submission and approval hub
5. **Reports** - Headcount, turnover, payroll summary

### Timesheet Workflow:
```
Employee View:
[Create Timesheet] ‚Üí Select Pay Period ‚Üí Enter Hours by Day ‚Üí [Submit]

Manager View:
[Pending Approvals (5)] ‚Üí Review Timesheet ‚Üí Check Hours ‚Üí [Approve / Reject with Comment]

Finance View:
[Approved Timesheets Ready for Payroll (12)] ‚Üí [Export to Payroll] ‚Üí Mark as Paid
```

### Advisory-Specific UI:
```
Projects Tab (instead of Teams):
- Project List
- For each project:
  - Project Leads (with role badges)
  - Student Employees (with student profile link)
  - Hours logged per student
  - Project timeline
```
