The Employees module should be the full entity management for all employees of NGI Capital and its entities besides NGI Capital Advisory LLC, it just connects from those apis since the onboarding and workflows for student employees are through those modules and it will sense from the api the employees and the project theyre on. It should also be entity level so when you view consolidate NGI Capital it shows all employees from all different entitties and their teams, then the specific entity when selected should show jsut the employees on that team. For NGI Capital and the creator terminal this should also be the workflows to add a new team to a entity and to add a new employee so it should be the onboarding of them, look through the same process as the NGI Capital advisory onboarding as wwe will use this same system and structure. Using gcal and gmail for the actual messeging but the workflows of onboarding through the app. in v2 we will add the full time sheet workflows to this employees module. We also want to think about what else is included in an employee management HR system and include some key features to v1.
