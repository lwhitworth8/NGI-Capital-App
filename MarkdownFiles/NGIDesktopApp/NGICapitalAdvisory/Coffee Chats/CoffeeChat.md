# Coffee Chats — Admin Overview (V1)

## Purpose
Manage student coffee chats using internal availability and Google Calendar + Meet — no external booking providers. Partners publish availability; students request; admins accept or propose; events are created in Google Calendar with Meet and appropriate reminders.

## Key Points
- Availability editor per admin; 15/30‑minute slots; 4‑week horizon; Google free/busy overlay; “Both free” intersection.
- Policies: one pending request; auto‑expiry at 7 days; cooldown after no‑show; blacklist after repeated cancels.
- Admin actions: accept/propose/cancel/no‑show/complete; claiming unowned requests.
- Events: accepting admin owns the Google event; invites both partners + student; reminders 1 day and 10 minutes.
- Dashboard includes a “Coffee Chats (7d)” KPI and telemetry for analytics.
