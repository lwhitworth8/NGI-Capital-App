## ‚ö†Ô∏è DATABASE INITIALIZATION NEEDED

### Current Problem:
Database is empty - no entities, no employees exist yet.

### Solution - Run These Scripts:
```bash
# 1. Initialize entities
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend python scripts/seed_accounting_entities.py

# 2. Sync Landon & Andre as employees
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend python scripts/sync_partners_to_employees.py

# 3. Verify
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend python -c "
from src.api.database import get_db
from sqlalchemy import text
db = next(get_db())
print('Entities:', db.execute(text('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entities')).scalar())
print('Employees:', db.execute(text('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees')).scalar())
"
```
