# Student Project Lead Manager â€“ Open Questions

- Chunked uploads: tus vs bespoke Content-Range? (Recommend tus-js-client + server support in V1.1)
- Slack channel naming and archival policy; handling re-opened/renamed projects
- Meeting notes (V2): attach notes/action items to meetings and link to tasks
- Timesheets reminders: prompt students to fill daily vs weekly; overdue nudges
- Data retention: storage caps and archival policy for large files

---
## Resolved Decisions (V1)
- Chunked uploads: use Content-Range in V1; adopt tus in V1.1.
- Slack channels: name proj-<code>-team; archive on project close; unarchive on reopen if code matches.
- Meeting notes: V2.
- Timesheet nudges: V2; weekly reminders later.
- Storage caps or archival policy for large files: V2 (no hard caps in V1).
