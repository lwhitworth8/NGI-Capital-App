## WHAT'S BETTER THAN QUICKBOOKS

### NGI CAPITAL > QUICKBOOKS

1. **Multi-Entity** - Native support (QB requires separate files)
2. **Consolidated Reporting** - Automatic (QB requires manual Excel)
3. **Approval Workflows** - Built-in dual approval (QB has none)
4. **Audit Trail** - Immutable log (QB can be modified)
5. **Period Locking** - Prevents backdating (QB can bypass)
6. **Fixed Assets** - Automated period-end (QB requires manual)
7. **Revenue Recognition** - Automated ASC 606 (QB basic)
8. **3-Way Matching** - Built-in (QB doesn't have this)
9. **Journal Entry Approval** - Dual approval required (QB has none)
10. **Consolidated GL** - Multi-entity GL (QB separate files)

### NGI CAPITAL = QUICKBOOKS

1. **Chart of Accounts** - Both GAAP compliant
2. **AR System** - Both full-featured
3. **AP System** - Both full-featured
4. **Bank Reconciliation** - Both have bank feeds
5. **Financial Reports** - Both generate GAAP statements

**BOTTOM LINE:** NGI Capital = Better than QuickBooks except for 3 non-critical features
