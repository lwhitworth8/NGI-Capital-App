Currently documents on the backend should have the ability to scan documents and intake all the data into the db for use thorughout the ngi capital app. Right now though the ui is not quite setup as we want. 1 it should have the entity selector and it should always be setup where NGI Capital (LLC rn but after we do post conversion will be de c corp) is the consolidated every entity together. SO we need the entity selector in the top right plus a search and a filter dropdown for search documents and filtewring for speic ones. The documents workflows should ask for all the business formation documation and it will use that throughout the system. This should be a nice ui and ux design. There should also be a place to upload the documents from the user. SO a nice ui for  the user to uplaod any documents. Banking should be connected ot the banking setup we have but ensure thas all setup perfeclty. This is the core source of our NGI Capital app data.
