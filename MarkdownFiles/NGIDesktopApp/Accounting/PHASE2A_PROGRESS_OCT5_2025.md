### MODERN PATTERNS IMPLEMENTED

#### 1. React 19 Patterns (Context7)
```typescript
// Memoized callbacks for performance
const buildTree = useCallback((accounts: Account[]) => {
  // Tree building logic
}, [])

const fetchAccounts = useCallback(async () => {
  // API call
}, [selectedEntityId, buildTree])

// Proper dependency arrays
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedEntityId) {
    fetchAccounts()
  }
}, [selectedEntityId, fetchAccounts])
```

#### 2. Framer Motion Animations
```typescript
// Page entrance
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.98 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
>

// Element animations
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
>
```

#### 3. Dynamic Imports (Next.js 14)
```typescript
const ChartOfAccountsView = dynamic(() => import('./ChartOfAccountsView'), {
  loading: () => <AnimatedSpinner />
});
```

#### 4. TypeScript Strict Mode
- All interfaces properly typed
- No any types used
- Proper null checks
- Type inference where possible

### BLOCKERS

**None!** [OK]

All dependencies installed, all code compiling, zero errors.

### RISKS

**Low Risk:**
- Old Chart of Accounts page still accessible
- Users might bookmark old URL
- Need to redirect or remove old route

**Mitigation:**
- Keep old page until user confirms working
- Add redirect from old page to new tab
- Update all internal links
- Update documentation

### TIMELINE

**Phase 2E:** Estimated 2-3 hours (Taxes)
**Phase 2F:** Estimated 3-4 hours (Cleanup + Redirects)

**Total Phase 2 Estimate:** 3-4 days (24-32 hours)

**Pace:** Ahead of schedule!
