## Date: October 5, 2025

## STATUS: READY FOR MANUAL TESTING [OK]

### WHAT WAS FIXED

1. **Import Case Sensitivity**
   - Changed `@/components/ui/Tabs` → `@/components/ui/tabs`
   - Changed `@/components/ui/Card` → `@/components/ui/card`
   - Changed `@/components/ui/Button` → `@/components/ui/button`

2. **Main Accounting Page**
   - Already configured to use `AccountingTabs` component
   - Entity selector works
   - Tab routing configured with URL params

3. **Tabs Created**
   - General Ledger (3 subtabs: COA, JE, TB)
   - Banking (Bank Reconciliation)
   - Reporting (2 subtabs: Financial, Consolidated)
   - AR, AP, Fixed Assets, Expenses, Taxes, Period Close, Documents (placeholders)

### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

#### Step 1: Start the App
```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run dev
```

#### Step 2: Navigate to Accounting
1. Open browser: `http://localhost:3001`
2. Navigate to `/accounting`
3. You should see:
   - "Accounting" header
   - Entity selector (top right)
   - **10 TABS** across the top:
     - General Ledger
     - Accounts Receivable
     - Accounts Payable
     - Fixed Assets
     - Expenses & Payroll
     - Banking
     - Reporting
     - Taxes
     - Period Close
     - Documents

#### Step 3: Test Each Tab

**A. General Ledger Tab (Cmd+1)**
1. Click "General Ledger" or press `Cmd+1` (or `Ctrl+1`)
2. You should see **3 subtabs**:
   - Chart of Accounts
   - Journal Entries
   - Trial Balance
3. Test each subtab:
   - Click "Chart of Accounts" - should show tree view
   - Click "Journal Entries" - should show entry list
   - Click "Trial Balance" - should show generate form

**B. Banking Tab (Cmd+6)**
1. Click "Banking" or press `Cmd+6`
2. You should see:
   - Bank account selector
   - Mercury sync button
   - Transaction table
   - Auto-match button
   - **Animated confidence score bars** (if data exists)

**C. Reporting Tab (Cmd+7)**
1. Click "Reporting" or press `Cmd+7`

   - Consolidated Reporting
3. Test each subtab

**D. Other Tabs**

- Should show placeholder content with "Coming Soon" or links to old pages

### WHAT TO LOOK FOR

✓ **Modern Design:**
- Clean tab interface
- Smooth animations when switching tabs
- Icons next to each tab label
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + 1-9)

✓ **Animations:**
- Tab content fades in smoothly
- Loading spinners rotate
- Cards zoom in gently
- Tables rows animate in sequentially

✓ **URL Updates:**
- URL should change when switching tabs
- Example: `/accounting?tab=gl`, `/accounting?tab=banking`
- Refreshing page should maintain selected tab

✓ **State Persistence:**
- Selected tab persists in localStorage
- Entity selection persists

### TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Main accounting page loads with tab navigation
- [ ] Can see all 10 tabs clearly
- [ ] General Ledger tab shows 3 subtabs
- [ ] Chart of Accounts loads and displays tree
- [ ] Journal Entries loads and shows list
- [ ] Trial Balance loads and shows controls

### IF YOU SEE THE OLD UI

**Problem:** Page still shows old dashboard or separate navigation items

**Solutions:**
1. **Hard Refresh:** Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. **Clear Cache:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. **Check URL:** Make sure you're at `/accounting` not `/accounting/chart-of-accounts`
4. **Check Console:** Open DevTools Console (F12) and look for errors

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

**NEW UI (What You Should See):**
```
[Accounting Header]
[Entity Selector]

[Tab: GL] [Tab: AR] [Tab: AP] [Tab: Fixed Assets] [Tab: Expenses] [Tab: Banking] [Tab: Reporting] [Tab: Taxes] [Tab: Period Close] [Tab: Documents]

[Tab Content Area with animations]
```

**OLD UI (What You Should NOT See):**
```
[Accounting Header]
[Dashboard with stats cards]
[Workflow status]
[Pending actions]
[Quick links to separate pages]
```

### COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

#### Issue 1: "Cannot find module '@/components/ui/Tabs'"
**Fix:** Already fixed! Updated to lowercase `tabs`

#### Issue 2: Tabs show but no content loads
**Check:**
- DevTools Console for errors
- Network tab for failed requests
- Component import paths

#### Issue 3: Animations not working
**Check:**
- framer-motion is installed: `npm list framer-motion`
- No console errors
- Browser supports CSS animations

### AFTER TESTING SUCCESSFULLY

Once you confirm everything works:

1. **Report back:** "New UI works! Ready to delete old code"

     - `/trial-balance`
     - `/bank-reconciliation`

     - Plus 5-6 more old pages
   - Update sidebar navigation (remove old links)
   - Add redirects from old URLs to new tab URLs
   - Clean up any unused backend code
   - Update documentation

3. **Estimated cleanup time:** 30 minutes
