- Returns dynamic data (NO hardcoding)

**Frontend UI:** `apps/desktop/src/app/accounting/tabs/reporting/`
- FinancialStatementsView.tsx - All 5 statements
- ConsolidatedReportingView.tsx - Multi-entity consolidation

## 📊 HOW IT WORKS

### 1. Monthly Financial Statement Generation

**Workflow:**
```
Month End → Period Close → Generate Financials → Review → Export Package
```

**Steps:**
1. **Record Transactions:** Create journal entries throughout the month
2. **Bank Reconciliation:** Match all bank transactions
3. **Adjusting Entries:** Record accruals, deferrals, depreciation
4. **Period Close:** Complete checklist, lock period
5. **Generate Statements:**
   - Go to Accounting → Reporting → Financial Statements
   - Select month (e.g., "December 2025")
   - Click "Generate Statements"
   - System queries trial balance for that period
   - Displays REAL data from your journal entries

**What You See:**
- **Balance Sheet:** All asset/liability/equity accounts with actual balances
- **Income Statement:** All revenue/expense accounts with actual balances
- **Cash Flows:** Reconciliation from net income to cash (requires JE analysis)
- **Equity Statement:** All capital contributions/distributions/net income
- **Notes:** Required GAAP disclosures

### 2. Consolidation Process (ASC 810)

**For Multi-Entity Reporting (Post-Conversion):**

**Entities:**
- NGI Capital LLC (Parent)
- NGI Capital Advisory LLC (Subsidiary)
- The Creator Terminal Inc. (Subsidiary)

**Consolidation Steps:**
1. **Tag Intercompany Transactions:**
   - When creating JE, mark as "Intercompany"
   - Specify counterparty entity
   - Example: Parent pays Advisory $10,000 management fee
     - Parent: DR Mgmt Fee Expense $10,000, CR Cash $10,000 [IC: Advisory]
     - Advisory: DR Cash $10,000, CR Mgmt Fee Revenue $10,000 [IC: Parent]

2. **Generate Consolidated:**
   - Go to Reporting → Consolidated Reporting
   - Click "Generate Consolidated"
   - System:
     - Fetches financial statements for each entity
     - Combines all accounts
     - Identifies intercompany transactions
     - Creates elimination entries
     - Presents consolidated view

**Elimination Entries (Automatic):**
```
1. Eliminate Investment in Subsidiary:
   DR  Subsidiary Equity Accounts
       CR  Investment in Subsidiary (Parent's BS)

2. Eliminate Intercompany Receivables/Payables:
   DR  IC Payable (Entity A)
       CR  IC Receivable (Entity B)

3. Eliminate Intercompany Revenue/Expenses:
   DR  IC Revenue (Entity A)
       CR  IC Expense (Entity B)
```
