# PHASE DECISION - WHAT'S NEXT?
Status: 170/170 tests passing (100%)
System: Production ready
Question: Phase 2 (tests) or Phase 3 (modules) next?

---

## OPTION A: PHASE 3 FIRST (RECOMMENDED)

**Complete remaining modules, THEN expand tests**

WHY THIS MAKES SENSE:
1. Test complete features, not incomplete ones
2. Avoid rewriting tests when features change
3. QA the modules you're about to test
4. More efficient workflow
5. Better test coverage of finished features

TIMELINE:
- Phase 3 (Module completion): 1-2 weeks
- Then Phase 2 (1000+ tests): 2-3 weeks
- Total: 3-5 weeks to fully done

MODULES TO COMPLETE:
1. NGI Capital Advisory - QA review, fix any issues
2. Admin Learning Center - Management features
3. Student App - Review all features
4. Marketing Homepage - Update to reflect app

THEN create comprehensive tests for EVERYTHING.

---

## OPTION B: PHASE 2 FIRST

**Expand to 1000+ tests now, complete modules later**

WHY THIS COULD WORK:
1. Test what exists now
2. Build test infrastructure
3. Complete modules get tested later

RISK:
- Test incomplete features
- May need to rewrite tests
- Less efficient

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION: OPTION A (PHASE 3 FIRST)

**REASONING:**

Current state:
- 170 tests validate EXISTING features (100% passing)
- Core accounting: Complete and tested
- Advisory: Working but needs QA
- Learning: Sprint 1 complete, needs Sprint 2+
- Student App: Needs review

Better to:
1. Complete the modules (1-2 weeks)
2. QA each module as you complete it
3. THEN build 1000+ tests for ALL completed features
4. Tests will be more accurate and comprehensive

**You'll end up with better tests if you test complete features.**

WHAT DO YOU PREFER?

A) Phase 3 first (complete modules, then 1000+ tests)
B) Phase 2 first (1000+ tests now, complete modules later)

I recommend A.
