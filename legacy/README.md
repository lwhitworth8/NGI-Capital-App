Quarantined Legacy and Scratch (Phase 0)

This folder collects code and files that are not part of the v1 application build, kept for historical reference:

- api/: contents moved from `src/api/legacy/`
- scripts/: contents moved from `scripts/legacy/`
- scratch/: assorted scratch and backup files moved from the repository root (e.g., `.tmp_*`, `temp_*`, `.git_prev_*`, `*.bak`)

Notes
- Nothing under `legacy/` is built or deployed.
- Refer to `docs/REORG_PLAN.md` for the migration plan and next steps.
