# DOCUMENT SYSTEM DEBUGGING - ACTIVE
**Status:** Adding comprehensive logging to diagnose upload failure

## WHAT WE KNOW:
- ✅ Backend API works (tested with curl - returns documents)
- ✅ Files ARE being saved to disk
- ✅ Database records ARE being created
- ❌ Frontend upload shows generic error
- ❌ No POST request visible in backend logs (fails before reaching server?)

## HYPOTHESIS:
- Might be CORS issue
- Might be authentication issue  
- Might be FormData formatting issue
- Might be frontend catching error before sending

## DEBUGGING STRATEGY:
1. Added comprehensive console.log statements
2. Will see EXACTLY where it fails
3. Will see what data is being sent
4. Will fix the root cause

## NEXT STEPS:
1. User refreshes page
2. User attempts upload
3. User checks console (F12)
4. User tells me what logs show
5. I fix the exact issue

## THEN:
- Upload will work perfectly
- User uploads all NGI Capital LLC documents
- We use real data for testing
- Build comprehensive test suite with confidence
